v2.2.0:
-retired the ggMAplot and profile plot functions and moved overhauled versions
to the new ATpoint/vizzy package
-retired the gene signatures functions, moved to the ATpoint/CreateGeneSignatures package
which now has only two minimal dependencies (matrixStats/RobustRankAggreg)

v2.1.0:
-complete overhaul of the PlotProfiles (now Plot.Profiles) function.
Cleaned up the code, simplified, shorter, more customizable.

v2.0.9:
-added BootyP_Ranges, a function to generate bootstrap p-values based on observed and random overlaps between GRanges objects
-removed all size parameters from PlotProfile to allow global theme_set()

v2.0.8:
-added run_apeglm to run apeglm shrinkage of DESeq2 LFCs incl automatic releveling to provide
coefs in resultsNames
-added DESeq2 and apeglm as dependency

v2.0.7:
-retired the goseq function, never used, removing the dependencies
-added the RobustRankAggreg:.rankMatrix source directly to the CreateGeneSignatures script so we can
remove that package as dependency. Referenced the package in ?CreateGeneSignatures
-added ... for gost() arguments to gosty()
-added type argument to MostVariable rows to choose between rowVars and modelGeneVar for selection

v2.0.6
-renamed prepare_DElists into RankedDElists and made code more clear plus putting comments and examples
-added examples to CreateGeneSignatures
-added method arg to binMatrix

v2.0.5:
-res_edgeR be default tests against log2(1.2) via glmTreat

v2.0.4:
-renamed prepare_SingleR into prepare_RankedLists
-added CreateGeneSignatures, a function which defines gene signatures for cell types in a rank-style fashion
-added RobustRankAggreg as dependency as CreateGeneSignatures uses it internally

v2.0.3:
-added ... to MAplotFromCts for smoothMAplot arguments
-added binMatrix function

v2.0.2:
-res_DESeq2() added switch for independent filtering

v2.0.1:
-cleaned up the ggMAplot function a bit and added example data
-example data res_DESeq2()
-MAplotFromCts for MA-plots for QC from norm. counts

v2.0.0:
-major overhaul of most functions. Added a DESeq2 results wrapper, simplyfied and made more generic the edgeR wrapper.
These wrappers now exclusively create the results, all other stuff such as plots etc. was removed, now to be done externally.
-simplified the ggplot functions by adding a constant basesize via theme_set().
-Retired several old functions, added some comments here and there.
-Removed the function descriptions in README, nobody going to ever read that anyway.
-Removed LSK dependency, added DESeq2 as dependency, 

v1.3.3:
-added plotMarker()

v1.3.2:
-added prepareDElists to accept lists of DE results and parse data into a list-like format
so combineMarkers() from scran can accept it. Is then used to infer marker genes.

v1.3.1:
-added prepareSingleR to prepare lists of upregulated genes from lists of DE results
to be used with SingleR::trainSingleR()

v1.3.0:
-added src_helpers.R with three functions:
  a) NormalizeByDeconvolution, for normalization of scRNA-seq data
  b) GBclust, graph-based clustering of scRNA-seq
  c) PlotXY, gg-based violinplots with jittered datapoints, e.g. to plot scRNA-seq QC metrics
  
v.1.2.15:
-added FDR.threshold to gosty()
-ensure that rownames are returned if using the averaging function of CountsTransformer()

v.1.2.14:
-added OnlySignif to gosty()

v.1.2.13:
-fixed rowScale function, it incorrectly did not use matrixStats::rowSds rather than base

v1.2.12:
-added Plot.ylim to plotProfiles()

v.1.2.11:
- added short description to README on what every function does

- renamed ggMAplot to ggMAlcano in the pairwiseMAplot function

- changed defaults in GetDate

- comments in some functions

v.1.2.1:

- Simplified the Module.edgeR function. It now only runs the dispersion estimation,
model fit and topTags functions. Normalization and CPMs are now excluded to be more customizable for the user upstream.
It also by default now outputs both MA-plots of the DGEList/topTags and a Volcano.

- outsourced the makeAllContrasts function that was in Module.edgeR into a separate function

- string2chr, a little helper function to split chr:start-end into a three-column data frame with one command.

- renamed ggMAplot into ggMAlcano because it was modified to produce either **MA**plots or Vo**lcanos**.

- Module.GOST renamed into gosty.
